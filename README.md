# AJ Madison React Protoype

This is the result of several hours of work on the code challenge provided on this repo. It's bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and leverages `typescript`. There are a few comments scattered throughout which may illuminate some of the thinking behind certain decisions which obviously I would not commit in other circumstances.

Thanks,
Ian

## Things I managed to do:

- Accurately recreate the look and feel of the desktop experience (there was some guess work here as to szings and margins).

- Implement an example of one of the three sorts suggested by the mockup (Sorting by price)

- Set up and maintain a story of book of all components (mostly because I like to work this way).

- Making a call to the actual API endpoint provided.

## Things I didn't get to:

- Mobile

- Some of the sorting

- Testing ðŸ˜­

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

**If you haven't done so already be sure to `yarn install` before running `yarn start`** <br />
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn storybook`

Starts up the storybook of components that I used to create the final product. <br />
Open [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) to view it in the browser
